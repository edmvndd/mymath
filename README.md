# mymath
Hi, my name is Edmund!
I'm a second year astrophysics major at Florida State.

_This is just a fun side projectl_
_If you stumble across this, please keep that in mind!_

A little about this project:
I want to create my own C++ math library, similar to <cmath>
that work with primitive data types
_(I might at a fraction class at a later date)_

Goals:
1. sin(x) using Taylor/Maclaurin series
2. cos(x) using Taylor/Maclaurin series
3. e^(x) using Taylor/Maclaurin series
4. arctan(x) using Taylor/Maclaurin series
5. ^ operator overload (to be used for exponentiation)
6. Some sort of definite integral implementation
